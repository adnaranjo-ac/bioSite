                <h2>About Harley</h2>
                <p> <h3>1.	Tell me about yourself.</h3>
                    I’m Harley. I’m 8. I go to ACA (Amarillo Collegiate Academy). I’m going to be a big sister.
                    <h5>She also felt that her liking candy was an important aspect of her story.</h5>

                    <h3>2.	What do you like doing/What are your hobbies?</h3>
                    Playing video games. 
                    <h5>She is also involved in Boy Scouts, has been taking gymnastics lessons (she mostly likes the trampoline time), and enjoys shooting guns with her daddy.</h5>
                    
                    <h3>3.	Do you have any goals for this year?</h3>
                    No not really.
                    
                    <h3>4.	What is your favorite subject at school?</h3>
                    Oh, that’s a hard one because I like all of them. If I really had to choose one, probably math. But um, like right now is probably science because we’re learning about animals.
                    
                    <h3>5.	If you could have anything in the world, what would you want?</h3>
                    A goldendoodle.
                    <h5>She makes $5 a week on chores. She told me once she was going to save up to buy her own Goldendoodle. I told her she would be out of the house by the time she could afford one. Needless to say, she hasn't saved any money towards one.</h5>
                    
                    <h3>6.	What is your biggest fear?</h3>
                    Heights.
                    
                    <h3>7.	What is your happiest memory?</h3>
                    I don’t know. When we went to the beach and found my ‘secret islands’.
                    <h5>We went to Gulfport, Mississippi for friends' wedding and took her down to the beach to play in the sand and walk around (not deep or warm enough to actually swim). She found sandbars and kept calling them her secret islands.Highway 90 literally runs along the beach.</h5>
                    
                    <h3>8.	If you could change anything about your family, what would you change?</h3>
                    Nothing.
                    
                    <h3>9.	What are you most looking forward to as you get older?</h3>
                    Being a singer as my career.
                    <h5>I'm honestly surprised this was not 'getting a cellphone'</h5>
                    
                    <h3>10.	What are you least looking forward to?</h3>
                    Nothing.
